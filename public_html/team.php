				Proud owner of Cottonwood Dairy and Compost, Symon Attema has been considered a classic example of entrepreneurship and the American dream.  Originating from the Netherlands, at a young age Symon came to America to be a pilot, and earned the highest pilot rating possible while at American Airlines. Ending an 18 year career in aviation, Symon took part in his Wife’s company, Tony’s Hay and Grain and grew the wholesale hay department of the organization.  In 2013, Symon and his wife Eileen bought Cottonwood Dairy, and have since, made an impressive example of an efficient dairy with their partner Marinus Dijkstra.<br/>
				Now, Symon has added another venture to his financial empire by initiating the start of Cottonwood Compost, a company focused on turning dairy waste into a valuable commodity for the agricultural community.

				Known as the man who can fix nearly anything, Marinus Dijkstra is the manager of Cottonwood Dairy.  Originally from the Netherlands, Marinus has been involved with the dairy business for over 20 years.  His current efforts of running Cottonwood Diary have been nothing short of innovation, and have stood as a model for the dairy industry altogether.  Within the next decade, Marinus hopes that he may be able to expand his dairy operations, and spread the innovative thinking behind Cottonwood Dairy.<br/>
				A part of his vast expertise, the development of efficient compost processing was thanks to him.  Our established facilities run very effectively under Mr. Dijkstra’s system, and they will continue to improve in time, providing a better product to you the customer.
